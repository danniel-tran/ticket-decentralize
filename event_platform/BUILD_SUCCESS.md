## Build Statistics

- **Total source lines:** 2,549 lines
- **Compilation errors:** 0 ❌
- **Compilation warnings:** 13 ⚠️
- **Build time:** ~15 seconds

---

## Warnings Summary

All warnings are **non-critical** and intentional:

### Unused Fields (7 warnings)
These fields are intentionally kept for metadata and future use:
- `EventMetadata.description` - Event description text
- `EventMetadata.walrus_blob_id` - Walrus storage reference
- `EventMetadata.image_url` - Event image URL
- `EventMetadata.tags` - Event categorization tags
- `EventConfig.requires_approval` - Future approval workflow

### Unused Constants (4 warnings)
Reserved for future features:
- `EProfileNotFound` - User lookup errors
- `ENotAuthorized` - Generic auth errors
- `ADMIN_LEVEL_SUPER_ADMIN` - Admin role levels
- `ADMIN_LEVEL_MODERATOR` - Moderator role levels

### Lint Warnings (2 warnings)
Self-transfer patterns in withdrawal functions:
- `payments::withdraw_funds` - Organizer withdraws to self (expected)
- `payments::withdraw_platform_fees` - Admin withdraws to self (expected)

These are **acceptable patterns** for withdrawal functions where users withdraw their own funds.

## Dependencies

```toml
[dependencies]
Sui = {
    git = "https://github.com/MystenLabs/sui.git",
    subdir = "crates/sui-framework/packages/sui-framework",
    rev = "framework/mainnet"
}
```

- ✅ Sui Framework (mainnet)
- ✅ MoveStdlib (auto-included)

---

## Fixes Applied

### Critical Fixes
1. **Vector of references not supported** - Changed `batch_mint_attendance(vector<&Ticket>)` to `mint_multiple_proofs(ticket1: &Ticket, ticket2: &Ticket)`
2. **Mutability errors** - Added `mut` to `ticket` parameter in `transfer_ticket()`
3. **Mutability errors** - Added `mut` to `payment_balance` in `process_payment()`
4. **Context mutability** - Changed `&TxContext` to `&mut TxContext` in `validate_ticket()`

### Cleanup
- Removed unused imports (`events::Self`, `payments::PlatformTreasury`)
- Removed truly unused error constants
- Kept intentional unused fields/constants for future use

---

## Module Integration

All modules correctly integrate:

```
access_control (Layer 1)
    ↓
users (Layer 2)
    ↓
payments (Layer 6)
    ↓
events (Layer 3) → uses: access_control, users, payments
    ↓
tickets (Layer 4) → uses: events, users, payments, access_control
    ↓
attendance (Layer 5) → uses: tickets, events, access_control
```

---

## Security Features ✅

All critical security features implemented:

- ✅ Capability expiration checks
- ✅ Ownership verification throughout
- ✅ Refund safety (all checks before consuming ticket)
- ✅ Atomic payment splitting
- ✅ Reentrancy protection (Checks-Effects-Interactions pattern)
- ✅ Exact payment amounts (no overpayment)
- ✅ Locked funds for refunds
- ✅ Permission-based access control

---

## Next Steps

### 1. Testing
Write comprehensive tests:
```bash
# Create test file
touch event_platform/tests/integration_tests.move

# Run tests
sui move test
```

### 2. Deployment (Testnet)
```bash
# Switch to testnet
sui client switch --env testnet

# Publish package
sui client publish --gas-budget 100000000

# Save object IDs:
# - Package ID
# - EventRegistry
# - PlatformTreasury
# - BadgeRegistry
# - AttendanceRegistry
```

### 3. Deployment (Mainnet)
```bash
# Switch to mainnet
sui client switch --env mainnet

# Publish package
sui client publish --gas-budget 100000000
```

---

## Known Limitations

1. **No vector<&T> support** - Batch operations use individual parameters
2. **No on-chain scheduling** - State transitions require manual calls
3. **Fixed platform fee** - 2.5% hardcoded (requires upgrade to change)
4. **Self-transfer in withdrawals** - Less composable but simpler UX

These are **acceptable trade-offs** for the current implementation.

---

## Frontend Integration

The bytecode modules are ready for frontend integration via:

- **Sui TypeScript SDK** - For transaction building
- **Programmable Transaction Blocks (PTB)** - For complex flows
- **GraphQL API** - For event indexing
- **Walrus SDK** - For decentralized storage
- **Seal SDK** - For encryption/decryption

Example PTB for buying a ticket:
```typescript
const txb = new TransactionBlock();
const payment = txb.splitCoins(txb.gas, [ticketPrice]);
const ticket = txb.moveCall({
  target: `${PACKAGE_ID}::tickets::mint_ticket`,
  arguments: [pool, event, profile, treasury, platformTreasury, registry, payment, ...],
});
txb.transferObjects([ticket], buyer);
await client.signAndExecuteTransactionBlock({ transactionBlock: txb, ... });
```
